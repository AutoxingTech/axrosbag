# Axrosbag <!-- omit in toc -->

When bad things happen, it's often too late to start recording with `rosbag record`.

`axrosbag` acts as an [accident data recorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_data_recorder).
It will rotatedly record last-N seconds of messages only in memory.
Only when requested, it shall dump saved messages into a [ROS bag file](http://wiki.ros.org/Bags).
